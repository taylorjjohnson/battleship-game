# Battleship

An Express and Socket.io based implementation of Battleship.

## Features

- Uses Gulp build tools with file watching and livereload for easier development
- Some use of the Handlebars view engine and templates

## Getting started

- Install: `npm install` to gather the dependencies

- Run: `gulp` to run the local server at `localhost:3000`, the gulp tasks include live reloading for views, css in public/css and restarting the server for changes to app.js or js in routes/

## To-Do

- Possibly break out some of the battleship.js functionality into a separate library
- Unit tests for both server and client-side functions
